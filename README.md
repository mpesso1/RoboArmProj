# RoboArmProj

Custom built robotic arm torque analysis.  Project started with full mechanical, electrical, and programing of custom robotic system.  Due to time and cost expenses project was cut back.  All equipment purchased was
reconfigured into autonomous elecric door using NEMA stepper moter, motor controler, power supply, acustic distance sensor, and arduino microcontroller.
